🛠️ Python Pandas Data Science Toolkit

This repository showcases my practical data-science skills using Python and pandas. It includes essential functions and two mini-projects that demonstrate my ability to clean, transform, and explore real-world datasets.

📦 What’s Inside
📘 Core Pandas Functions

A compact reference of commonly used pandas techniques, including:

Importing and loading data

Filtering, sorting, and selecting

Handling missing values and duplicates

Grouping, aggregations, and joins

String operations and data type management

🧼 Data Cleaning Project

A hands-on example cleaning a consumer contact list:

Standardized text fields and phone numbers

Split and reformatted addresses

Normalized categorical labels

Removed duplicates and invalid entries

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Project

An EDA of global population data:

Summary statistics and missing-value checks

Correlation heatmaps and trend analysis

Grouped population patterns by continent

Outlier detection and data-type inspection

🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates my ability to prepare, clean, and analyze data—core skills for data science and analytics workflows.
