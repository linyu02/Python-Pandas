🛠️ Python Pandas Toolkit

This repository is a compact showcase of my practical Python pandas skills for data science. It brings together essential data-handling techniques—loading files, filtering, grouping, aggregating, joining, and cleaning strings—into one place for quick reference and learning.

What’s Inside
- Core Functions:
  A collection of commonly used pandas operations for everyday data-wrangling tasks.

- Data Cleaning (Toy Project 1):
  Examples of fixing messy consumer contact data: handling missing values, standardizing formats, cleaning text fields, and removing duplicates.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (Toy Project 2):
  Queries and visuals for understanding global population data through descriptive statistics, correlations, trends, and first-look insights.
